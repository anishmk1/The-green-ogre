Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad. Angered by the intrusion, the ogre decides to pay Farquaad a visit and demand they be moved elsewhere.

"Lord Farquuad!" ogre yelled. "Hello ogre" Farquaad replied. "I demand these annoying fairy tale characters be removed from my domain!" the ogre said. "Well, you see ogree...", before Farquaad could finish the ogre grabbed Farquaad's body with his meaty hands and threw him out of the castle window.

Farquaad's tiny legs couldn't help him now, as if they ever had before. With a satisfying thUNk the green ogre had actually completed the request and removed the most annoying fairy tale character from the late Lord Farquuad's domain.
